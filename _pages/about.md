I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Baidu Inc in Shanghai. My work includes using NLP techniques for static analysis, and leveraging machine learning methods for risk evaluation for continuous integration. Previously I obtained my master's degree in Informatics at University of Zurich and my bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering at Southeast University.
